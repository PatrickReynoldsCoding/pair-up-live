Born from a 5-person team project during the Makers Academy Bootcamp, this platform is designed to enhance your coding skills through collaboration. The front-end is built with React, navigated with React-router-dom, and styled with Material UI React. The database is powered by MongoDB and Mongoose, with user authorization handled through Passport JWT and JSON WEB TOKENS. The video chat is powered by socket.io and simple-peer. Rigorously tested with Jest and Cypress, and integrated through GitHub CI, this platform offers a seamless experience for coders to connect and work together.
